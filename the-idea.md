# AI Startup Methodology Coach

## Project Idea Document

### üéØ Core Vision

**Transform how entrepreneurs build products by embedding lean startup methodology directly into their workflow through AI-powered coaching.**

Instead of entrepreneurs creating bloated documentation and building unvalidated features, our software guides them step-by-step through hypothesis-driven experimentation, generating the right documents at the right time while actively coaching them toward better startup practices.

---

### üöÄ The Problem We're Solving

**Current State:** Entrepreneurs default to "waterfall" thinking:

- Create detailed competitive analyses (100+ pages)
- Write comprehensive PRDs before validation
- Build features based on assumptions, not data
- Treat business plans as facts, not hypotheses

**Pain Points:**

- Teams waste months building the wrong things
- Founders don't know how to apply lean methodology practically
- Good startup advice exists but isn't embedded in workflows
- Templates exist but don't guide behavior change

**The Gap:** There's no tool that actively coaches entrepreneurs through the lean startup process while they work.

### üí° Our Solution

**An AI-powered workflow coach that:**

1. **Ingests User Ideas**: "I want to build a learning platform for kids"
2. **Identifies Missing Information**: Analyzes phase templates to determine required data
3. **Guides Discovery**: Asks Socratic questions to help users find answers themselves
4. **Generates Actionable Tasks**: Creates specific todos with expected outputs
5. **Validates Against Principles**: Challenges responses that violate manifesto guidelines
6. **Produces Quality Documents**: Generates lean, hypothesis-driven documentation
7. **Enables Phase Transitions**: Uses completed work to inform next phase guidance

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

**Core Components:**

- **LangChain/GraphFlow**: Orchestrates the AI workflow and decision tree
- **Template Parser**: Analyzes existing phase templates to extract requirements
- **Manifesto Validator**: Checks user responses against the 7 Commandments
- **Document Generator**: Creates final documents using validated information
- **Task Generator**: Produces actionable todo lists with expected outcomes

**Workflow Engine:**

```
User Input ‚Üí Template Analysis ‚Üí Information Gap Identification ‚Üí
Guided Questioning ‚Üí Response Validation ‚Üí Task Generation ‚Üí
Document Creation ‚Üí Phase Transition
```

### üìã User Journey Example

**Scenario:** "I want to build a learning platform for kids"

**Research Phase Workflow:**

1. **Input**: User states their idea
2. **Template Analysis**: System reads research-phase template requirements
3. **Gap Identification**: "We need: target customer definition, problem validation, competitive landscape"
4. **Guided Questions**:
   - "Who specifically are these 'kids'? Ages? Learning contexts?"
   - "What specific learning problem are you solving?"
   - "How do you know this problem exists?"
5. **Response Validation**: If user says "All parents want this" ‚Üí Challenge with "How will you test this assumption?"
6. **Task Generation**: "Interview 5 parents of kids aged 6-10 about their learning frustrations - Expected output: 3 validated pain points"
7. **Document Creation**: Generate lean research brief with hypotheses, not assumptions
8. **Phase Transition**: "Ready for design phase? Here's what we learned about your customers..."
